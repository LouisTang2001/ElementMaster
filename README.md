## ElementMaster can help you:

- :smile:Model: You can add models by drawing with the mouse or manually setting the coordinates. After modeling, please remember to add Poisson's ratio and Elasticity modulus of the material. 

- Mesh Partition: You can mesh through clicking the "网格" button after modeling successfully.

- Compute: Perform computations by clicking "计算" button.

- Generate Stress-Strain Contour Plot: Generate a stress-strain contour plot by clicking the related button.

Please note that the the project is develped in Qt Creator 9.0.2.
