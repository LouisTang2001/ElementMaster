  <h2><strong>A simple Software for Finite Element Method</strong></h2>
</div>

**ElementMaster** is a finite element analysis software that allows users to model, mesh partition, compute, and generate stress-strain contour plots.

## Usage Examples:

- :eyes:Model: You can add models by drawing with the mouse or manually setting the coordinates. After modeling, please remember to add Poisson's ratio and Elasticity modulus of the material. 

- :sweat_drops:Mesh Partition: You can mesh through clicking the "网格" button after modeling successfully.

- :boom:Compute: Perform computations by clicking "计算" button.

- :raised_back_of_hand:Generate Stress-Strain Contour Plot: Generate a stress-strain contour plot by clicking the related button.

- :hankey: Deletion of Existing Models: After the calculations are complete, you have the option to delete the existing models.
- :robot: User Log: The software keeps a log to record user operations and actions.

Please note that the the project is develped in **Qt Creator 9.0.2**.
